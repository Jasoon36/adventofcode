Initially did a few days from 2023 to:

- understand the format of the problems
- organise repo
- write a class

Little things in base python I've never used till now:

- str.split()
- default value of dict.get() (prefer this over defaultdict)
- transposing a list of lists (always had numpy)
- set comparisons
