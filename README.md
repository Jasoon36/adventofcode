# Advent of Code

Personal attempts at Advent of Code 2024 using base python, no imported libraries.  
Perhaps a missed opportunity to (re)learn regular expressions.

I will likely not have time to tidy up my code, so look at the most recent day(s) completed, for "clean" code.

Completion Tracker:

|Year|Day|Completion Date|
|-|-|-|
| 2023 | 3 | 2024-11-17 |
| 2023 | 2 | 2024-11-11 |
| 2023 | 1 | 2024-11-10 |

Initially did a few days from 2023 to:

- understand the format of the problems
- organise repo
- write a class
